# LAN 2018 AI@Philadelphia
## Meetup Title
Computer Vision and Deep Learning: King or Queen?
## Where
TBD

## When
Wednesday, October 10th

### Start Time
4:30 PM
### End Time
5:30 PM
## Description
[Being Updated]
Computer Vision projects and this session are interesting to me personally since my first job involved tracking eagles using long range camera and MatLab implementation of OpenCV in 2013. For those who are familiar with A.Rosebrock, the "Cat or Dog" Example in OpenCV is not new. In this session, we will start by his work as the starting template and "take it for a spin" (we see how it performs on a testing dataset) then with few tricks we tune it for a our own dataset on an S3 bucket on an AWS account. Throughout the rest of the session we aim on improving the performance of the model.

[The slides will be uploaded on here after the session.](https://github.com/lotusxai/LAN-Workshops)


### Topics
* Tips: Collecting Images from Google Search
* Tips: Collecting Images from Bing using Microsoft Cognitive API
* Tips: Job Postings for Computer Vision Roles: [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/jobs/job_board)
* Regression vs Classification

Computer Vision is a big field and [one good reference to get started is from A.Rosebrock OpenCV Training work](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/static/cv_dl_resource_guide.pdf)

This group meeting is from **Overfitting for the Polite Data Scientists** Series that combines the power of Kaggle and its publicly available Data and Kernels with the computing resources hosted by Amazon computing network knowns at AWS or Amazon Web Services. In each group meeting, competing models sharing a common Data are being ran and their results are being discussed. More information about the data and the slides are shared before hand to increase engagement and participations of anyone who shows-up.


## For Who:
Either of the following groups should find the sessions useful:

Researchers and Professionals from Technical backgrounds in Data Engineering, Statistics or Computer Science background will see few winning models from Kaggle compete. Data Engineers who bother mostly with collecting data or ETL processes.

Technical Recruiters who wants to know How much data is big data. Image Data add up pretty quickly in size and their I/O costs from/to an S3 buckets can grow out of the AWS allowed Free range very quickly.

Finally, the future talents that are coming from a diverse background, technically or ethnically, and are willing to re-generate the results and learn by-doing. This is the best way that I know to learn Data Science and with all the buzz that is going on in Machine Learning and Data Science I am aiming to build a content accessible for free. The codes will be made available here for your practice using LAN Github Repo and AWS resources. You won't need anything else besides a keen wanting for building and learn-by-doing. AWS and (recently Kaggle) account are available for Free and you can leverage these recourses from day one. The reproduction costs are based on Free Tier units on AWS and as of now are free (some conditions apply).
