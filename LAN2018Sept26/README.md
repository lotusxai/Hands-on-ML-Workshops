[The slides will be uploaded on here after the session.](https://github.com/lotusxai/LAN-Workshops)


This presentation is from Overfilling for Polite Data Scientists Series that combines the power of Kaggle and its publically available Data and Kernels with the computing resources hosted by Amazon computing network knowns at AWS or Amazon Web Services. In each presentation, competing models sharing a common Data are being ran and their results are being discussed.


## For Who:
Either of the two following groups should find the presentation useful and the network valuable:

Audience from Technical backgrounds in Data Engineering, Statistics or Computer Science background will see few winning models from Kaggle compete.

Audience from Business, Sales, Marketing and Technical Recruiting background will experience of what it means to be "Data Oriented" while appreciating its worth and merits.

Finally, the future talents that are coming from a diverse background, technically or ethnically, and are willing to re-generate the results and learn by-doing. The codes will be made available here for your practice using LAN Github Repo and AWS resources. You won't need anything else besides the keen urge and wanting to learn and an AWS or Kaggle account. The reproduction costs are based on Free Tier units on AWS and completely free.
