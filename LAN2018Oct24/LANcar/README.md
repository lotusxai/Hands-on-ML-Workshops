DeepPicar is a low-cost autonomous RC car platform using a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). DeepPicar is a small scale replication
of NVIDIA's real self-driving car called Dave-2, which drove on public
roads using a CNN. DeepPicar uses the same CNN architecture of NVIDIA's
Dave-2 and can drive itself in real-time locally on a Raspberry Pi 3.

If you wish to recreate the paper's findings, you can train a model using our dataset which can be found at:

## Hardware Configuration
DeepPicar is comprised of the following components:

* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B: $35
* New Bright 1:24 scale RC car: $10
* Playstation Eye camera: $7
* Pololu DRV8835 motor hat: $8
* External battery pack & misc.: $10

## Installation

Install the following:

	$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv python-serial python-dev

You also need to install Tensorflow.

The repository can then be cloned with the following command:

	$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mbechtel2/DeepPicar-v2


## Driving DeepPicar
For manual control:

	$ python picar-mini-kbd-common.py  -t <throttle %> -n <#of cpu to use>

The controls are as follows:
* 'a': drive the car forward
* 'z': drive the car backward
* 's': stop the car
* 'j': turn the car left
* 'k': center the car
* 'l': turn the car right
* 't': toggle video view
* 'r': record video

For autonomous control:

	$ python  picar-mini-kbd-common.py -t <throttle %> -n <#of cpu to use> -d

## Model Training
Before training a model, the following changes should be made:

Change model (folder) name:

	save_dir = os.path.abspath('...') #Replace ... with a name for the model

Change if normal category is to be used:

	use_normal_category = True #True = equally select center/curve images, False = no equal selection

Select epochs to be used for training and validation in the params.py file:

	epochs['train'] = [...] #Replace ... with integer values used to represent epochs  
	epochs['val'] = [...] #Replace ... with integer values used to represent epochs

After all of the above steps are completed, The model can then be trained
by running:

	$ python train.py

## Embedded Computing Platform Evaluation
By default, the platforms are tested over epoch 6 (out-video-6.avi), but
the epochs processed can be changed by altering epoch_ids in test-model.py:

	epoch_ids = [...] #Replace ... with all epochs to be processed

Also, epochs can be processed more than once (i.e. epoch_ids = [6,6] would
have the platform process epoch 6 twice).

The number of frames processed can be increased/decreased as well by
changing:

	NFRAMES = _ #Replace _ with the total number of frames to process

### Evaluation

#### Setup

Before running evaluations, the following steps should be taken:

Create the directory where all test results will be stored:

	$ mkdir datafiles

Turn off lightdm:

	$ sudo service lightdm stop

Run the appropriate scripts for maximizing performance:

	$ ./scripts/maxperf.sh #Raspberry Pi 3 Only
	$ ./scripts/jetson-clocks.sh #NVIDIA TX2 Only

#### Evaluation Scripts

For convenience, the platforms can be fully tested by running the following
scripts:

Raspberry Pi 3:

	$ ./scripts/model-tests.sh #Should also be Intel UP Board
	$ ./scripts/memguard-tests.sh
	$ ./scripts/palloc-tests.sh

NVIDIA Jetson TX2:

	$ ./scripts/tx2-tests.sh

All scripts will create a datafiles/Dataset-temp directory that will contain all of the experiment logs. It should be renamed before running another script or its contents may be partially, or completely, overwritten.
