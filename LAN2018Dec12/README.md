About Our Speaker:

Our speaker details will be updated soon. We will be having speakers from the local startups and consulting companies that heavily use AWS in various stages of their DevOps. We will announce the Speakers from time to time but ideally, all December Meetups at LAN will have certified AWS product managers and engineers section.

This group meeting is from **Overfitting for the Polite Data Scientists** Series that combines the power of Kaggle and its publicly available Data and Kernels with the computing resources hosted by Amazon computing network knowns at AWS or Amazon Web Services. In each group meeting, competing models sharing a common Data are being run and their results are being discussed. More information about the data and the slides are shared beforehand to increase the engagement and participation of anyone who shows up.


## For Who:
This session is will have a speaker section so please pay attention to the comment section. Also, I'm starting to ask members to RSVP at LAN Eventbrite page also. Many members had a hard time keeping track of their notifications and event updates in the past and I hope this helps LAN members to stay in touch without getting too many notifications. This event would be a combination of product design and data pipeline review and we can dive into technical AWS configuration topics for anyone interested. Also, either of the following groups should find the sessions useful:

Researchers and Professionals from Technical backgrounds in Data Engineering, Statistics or Computer Science background will see few winning models from Kaggle compete.

Secondly, the future talents that are coming from a diverse background, technically or ethnically, and are willing to re-generate the results and learn by-doing. This is the best way that I know to learn Data Science and with all the buzz that is going on in Machine Learning and Data Science I am aiming to build a content accessible for free. The codes will be made available here for your practice using LAN Github Repo and AWS resources. You won't need anything else besides a keen wanting for building and learn-by-doing. AWS and (recently Kaggle) account are available for Free and you can leverage these recourses from day one. The reproduction costs are based on Free Tier units on AWS and as of now are free (some conditions apply).

Finally, Technical Recruiters and Marketing Guru who would like to learn about Streaming Learning and the few key players in the field.
