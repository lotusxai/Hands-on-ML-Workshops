This group meeting is from **Overfitting for the Polite Data Scientists** Series that combines the power of Kaggle and its publicly available Data and Kernels with the computing resources hosted by Amazon computing network knowns at AWS or Amazon Web Services. In each group meeting, competing models sharing a common Data are being run and their results are being discussed. More information about the data and the slides are shared beforehand to increase the engagement and participation of anyone who shows up.


## For Who:

Researchers and Professionals from Technical backgrounds in Data Engineering, Statistics or Computer Science background will see few winning models from Kaggle compete. For November and December sessions more technical topics are marked in the Topic section. The Github Repo would be the best reference for the technical crowd to measure the technical level of the contents.

Technical Recruiters and Marketing Guru who would like to learn about Streaming Learning and the few key players in the field.

Finally, the future talents that are coming from a diverse background, technically or ethnically, and are willing to re-generate the results and learn by-doing. This is the best way that I know to learn Data Science and with all the buzz in Machine Learning and Data Science I am aiming to build a content that'll be accessible for free. The codes will be made available here for your practice using LAN Github Repo and AWS resources. LAN does provided IAM users to run the scripts on AWS when possible and if not, the reproduction costs are based on Free Tier units on AWS, except for few sessions, and as of now are free (some conditions apply).
