This group meeting is from **Certain about the Certification** Series that focuses on reviewing the contents from Architect and Developer Associate Certification Exam. Two Exams I've taken in 2017. In each training session, we start with few scenario problems that are common in the exams and then depending on days topic we will switch to the [trending questions on StackOverflow with AWS Tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-web-services)


## For Who:
Either of the following groups should find the these series useful:

Researchers and Professionals from Technical backgrounds in Data Engineering, Statistics or Computer Science background that would like to also get more hands-on experience on AWS Resources and are looking to take on the Certification Exams one day.

Secondly, the future talents that are coming from a diverse background, technically or ethnically, and are planning on taking the Certification Exams soon. Almost all open positions in Data Science would require some experience with some Cloud Computing vendor (Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud) and having a Certification from one of these major vendors, Amazon at LAN, would double your chance to get an interview, which should be all your focus! Sundays are not the best day to work but it's the only day that I can find for this new Series first session.
